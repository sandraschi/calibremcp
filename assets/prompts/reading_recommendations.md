# Reading Recommendations

What should I read next? Analyze my Calibre library collection, reading history, and current series progress to provide personalized reading recommendations. Use Austrian efficiency to eliminate decision paralysis - give me specific book suggestions with priority rankings and tell me exactly which book I should read right now.

Include any incomplete series I should continue and books that match my interests.
